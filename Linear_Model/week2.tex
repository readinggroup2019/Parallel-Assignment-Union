% Problem 2.24

\begin{problem}{2.24}
  Using the tools outlined in the two exercises above, for a design matrix $\mathbf{X}$ we can construct a sequence of Householder 
  matrices $\mathbf{U}_1,...,\mathbf{U}_p$ following (2.13) and (2.14) such that 
  $$\mathbf{U}_p...\mathbf{U}_2\mathbf{U}_1\mathbf{X}=\left[\begin{array}{c}{\mathbf{R}} \\{\mathbf{0}}\end{array}\right]$$
  where $\mathbf{R}$ is square and upper triangular.
  \begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item Show that $\mathbf{U}_p...\mathbf{U}_2\mathbf{U}_1\mathbf{X}$ is an orthogonal matrix.
    \item Show that $\mathbf{R^TR = X^TX}$.(Note that $\mathbf{R}$ constructed this way may differ from Gramâ€“Schmidt by signs.)
  \end{enumerate}

  Prove the converse to Result 3.2: if the least squares estimator $\lambda^T \mathbf{\hat{b}}$ is the same for 
  all solutions $\mathbf{\hat{b}}$ to the normal equations, then $\lambda^T \mathbf{b}$ is estimable.

  Recall the two-way crossed problem in Section 3.5. 
  \begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item Show that $\mathbf{G}^T$ is a generalized inverse for $\mathbf{X^TX}$,and then compute both $\mathbf{\left(X^TX\right)G^T}$ and $\mathbf{I-G\left(X^TX\right)}$.
    \item Find the solution $\mathbf{GX^Ty}$ to the normal equations. Also compute the solution $\mathbf{G^TX^Ty}$.
    \item Find the least squares estimators for the following estimable functions:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $\mu+\alpha_{i}+\beta_{j}$
      \item $\alpha_{i}-\alpha_{k}$
      \item $\beta_{j}-\beta_{k}$
      \item $\sum d_{i} \alpha_{i}$ with $\sum d_{i}=0$

\begin{problem}{3.11(e)}
  Consider the following two-way crossed ANOVA model with interaction and replication:
  $$
  y_{ijk}=\mu+\alpha_{i}+\beta_{j}+\gamma_{ij}+e_{ijk}
  $$
  for $i = 1,...,a$,$j = 1,...,b$, and $k = 1,...,n_{ij} \geq 1$.First simplify matters with $a = 2, b = 3$, and $n_{ij} = n$.
  \begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item Write this as a linear model by writing $\mathbf{Xb}$.
    \item Find $rank(\mathbf{X}) = r$.
    \item Find a set of $r$ linearly independent estimable functions.
    \item Give a set of $p - r$ jointly nonestimable functions.
