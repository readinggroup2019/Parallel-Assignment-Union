% Problem 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{9.1.1}
(a) Show that under the two-sample model, the difference of the sample averages, $\bar{y}_{2}-\bar{y}_{1}$, has variance $\left(n_{1}+n_{2}\right) \sigma^{2} /\left(n_{1} n_{2}\right)$. Show that subject to $n_1 + n_2 = n$, this is minimized
when $n_1$ and $n_2$ are as nearly equal as possible.

(b) Suppose that $n$ units are split into $k$ blocks of size $m + 1$, and that one unit in each block is chosen at random to be treated, while the remaining m are controls. Suppose that the responses in the $j$-th block are $y_{j1}$ and $y_{j2},\cdots, y_{j(m+1)}$, and let $d_j$ represent the
difference between the treated individual and the average of the controls. Show that the
average of these differences has variance $(m+1) \sigma^{2} /(k m)$, and show that for fixed $n$ this is minimized when $m = 1$.

% Problem 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{9.1.2}
Suppose a paired comparison experiment is performed, in which the $j$-th pair satisfies the normal linear model

$$y_{0,}=\mu_{j}-\delta+\varepsilon_{0 j}, \quad y_{1 j}=\mu_{j}+\delta+\epsilon_{1 j}, \quad j=1, \ldots, \ldots$$

but that data analysis is performed using the two-sample model. Show that the variance estimator can be written as

$$S^{2}=\frac{1}{2(m-1)} \sum_{j, t}\left(\mu_{j}-\bar{\mu}+\varepsilon_{t j}-\bar{\varepsilon}_{\ldots}\right)^{2}$$

Deduce that this has expected value $\sigma^{2}+(m-1)^{-1} \sum_{i}\left(\mu_{j}-\bar{\mu}_{\cdot}\right)^{2}$ conditional on the $\mu_j$, and hence show that if the Âµj are normally distributed with variance $\tau_2$, then $\mathbb{E}(S_2) =\sigma^{2}+\tau^{2}$.

Show that if the two-sample model is used in this situation, the length of a $95\%$ confidence interval for $2\delta$ is roughly $2\left(\sigma^{2}+\tau^{2}\right)^{1 / 2} t_{2(m-1)}(0.025)$, whereas under the paired comparisons model the length is about $2 \sigma t_{m-1}(0.025)$. 

For what values of $\tau^{2} / \sigma^{2}$ are the two-sample intervals shorter when 

(a) $m = 3$, 

(b) $m = 11$? 

Discuss your results.
