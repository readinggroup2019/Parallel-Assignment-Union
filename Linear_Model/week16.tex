%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{10.4.1}
Data $y_{1}, \ldots, y_{n}$ are assumed to follow a binary logistic model in which $y_{j}$ takes value 1 with probability $\pi_{j}=\exp \left(x_{j}^{\mathrm{T}} \beta\right) /\left\{1+\exp \left(x_{j}^{\mathrm{T}} \beta\right)\right\}$ and value 0 otherwise, for $j=1, \ldots, n$.

(a) Show that the deviance for a model with fitted probabilities $\widehat{\pi}_{j}$ can be written as
\[
D=-2\left\{y^{\mathrm{T}} X \widehat{\beta}+\sum_{j=1}^{n} \log \left(1-\widehat{\pi}_{j}\right)\right\}
\]
and that the likelihood equation is $X^{\mathrm{T}} y=X^{\mathrm{T}} \widehat{\pi} .$ Hence show that the deviance is a function of the $\widehat{\pi}_{j}$ alone.

(b) If $\pi_{1}=\cdots=\pi_{n}=\pi,$ then show that $\widehat{\pi}=\bar{y},$ and verify that
\[
D=-2 n\{\bar{y} \log \bar{y}+(1-\bar{y}) \log (1-\bar{y})\}
\]
Comment on the implications for using $D$ to measure the discrepancy between the data and fitted model.

(c) $\operatorname{In}(\mathrm{b}),$ show that Pearson's statistic (10.21) is identically equal to $n .$ Comment.

\begin{problem}{10.4.2}
	(a) Show that the parametric link function
	$$g(\pi ; \gamma)=\log \left[\gamma^{-1}\left\{(1-\pi)^{-\gamma}-1\right\}\right], \quad \gamma \neq 0$$
	gives the logit and complementary log-log links when $\gamma=1$ and when $\gamma \rightarrow 0$.
	Give a similar function containing the logit and log-log link functions.
	(b) Show that the link function
	$$g(\pi ; \gamma)=\log \left[\gamma^{-1}\left\{(1-\pi)^{-\gamma}-1\right\}\right], \quad \gamma \neq 0$$
	is symmetric for all Î³ and gives the logit and identity functions when $\gamma \rightarrow 0$ and when $\gamma=1$.
