% Problem 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{5.2}
Prove the following theorem related to Cochran’s Theorem: Let $\mathbf{A}_i, i = 1, \cdots , k$
be $p × p$ symmetric matrices such that $\sum \mathbf{A}_i = \mathbf{I}_p$. Then the following three
conditions are equivalent:

a. $\mathbf{A}_{i} \mathbf{A}_{j}=\mathbf{0}$ for $i \neq j$

b. $\mathbf{A}_{i}$ are all idempotent.

c. $\sum r a n k\left(\mathbf{A}_{i}\right)=p$
\end{problem}

% Problem 2

\begin{problem}{5.20}
	Prove the following converse to Cochran’s Theorem: Let $\mathbf{y} \sim N_{p}\left(\mu, \sigma^{2} \mathbf{I}_{p}\right)$ and
	let $\mathbf{A}_i, i = 1,\cdots, k$ be symmetric matrices with rank $n_i$. If $\left(1 / \sigma^{2}\right) \mathbf{y}^{T} \mathbf{A}_{i} \mathbf{y}$ are
	independently distributed as $\chi_{s_{i}}^{2}\left(\phi_{i}\right)$, then $n_i = s_i, i = 1, \cdots , k$ and $\sum n_i = p$.
