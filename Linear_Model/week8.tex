% Problem 4
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem}{7.11 (a)(b)(f)(g)(h)}
In many situations, we assume that a subject responds in a linear way to the dosage level. Consider measuring a response $y_{i j}$ to dosage level $i$ on subject $j, j=1,2$ (balanced, $n_{i}=2$ ), $i=1, \ldots, a=4,$ leading to the familiar one-way ANOVA model:
$$
y_{i j}=\mu+\alpha_{i}+e_{i j}(\operatorname{model} 1)
$$
Assume, as usual, that $e_{i j}$ are iid $N\left(0, \sigma^{2}\right) .$ We are interested in testing the hypothesis that the response is linear in the dosage, where this reduced model might be written as
$$
y_{i j}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} x_{i}+e_{i j}(\operatorname{model} 2)
$$
where $x_{i}=i, i=1, \ldots, 4$

a. Write out $E(\mathbf{y})=\mathbf{X} \mathbf{b}$ for the full model (model 1 ) by giving $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{b}$. Also give $\operatorname{rank}(\mathbf{X})$.

b. Write out $E(\mathbf{y})=\mathbf{W} \mathbf{c}$ for the reduced model (model 2 ) by giving $\mathbf{W}$ and
$\mathbf{c}$. Also give $\operatorname{rank}(\mathbf{W})$.

f. Show that each component of $\mathbf{K}^{T} \mathbf{b}$ is estimable (so that the hypothesis is testable).

g. For the following data, compute $\left(\mathbf{K}^{T} \hat{\mathbf{b}}-\mathbf{m}\right)^{T}\left[\mathbf{K}^{T}\left(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X}\right)^{g} \mathbf{K}\right]^{-1}$
$\left(\mathbf{K}^{T} \hat{\mathbf{b}}-\mathbf{m}\right)$.

h. Give the distribution of $\mathbf{y}^{T}\left(\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{X}}-\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{W}}\right) \mathbf{y} / \sigma^{2}$ under both model 1 and model $2 .$
