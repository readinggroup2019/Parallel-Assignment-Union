% Problem 1

\begin{problem}{4.6}
	 Consider the covariance function
	\[
	r_{y}(t)=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{4 \alpha \omega_{0}^{2}} e^{-\alpha|t|}\left(\cos \beta t+\frac{\alpha}{\beta} \sin \beta|t|\right)
	\]
	of the linear oscillator in Example 4.5 on page 138 The covariance function contains some non-differentiable $|t| ;$ show that it still fulfills a condition for sample function differentiability, but not for twice differentiability.
	
	Find the relation between the relative damping $\zeta$ and the spectral width parameter $\alpha=\omega_{2} / \sqrt{\omega_{0} \omega_{4}}.$

\begin{problem}{4.7}
Define
\[
v(T)=V\left(\frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T} x(t) \mathrm{d} t\right)
\]
and assume $\{x(t), t \in \mathbb{R}\}$ has a bounded spectral density $f(\omega)$. Find the relation between $f(0)$ and the asymtotic behavior of $v(T)$ as $T \rightarrow \infty.$

\begin{problem}{4.14}
	Take a spectral distribution $F(\omega)$ with unit mass over $(-\pi, \pi],$ with $F(\pi)-F(-\pi+)=1,$ and let the random variable $v$ be distributed according to $F$. Also, let $u$ be uniformly distributed over $[-\pi, \pi),$ and independent of $v .$ Prove that the random sequence $x_{n}=e^{i(v n+u)}$ is stationary, compute its covariance function, and show that its spectrum is $F$.

\begin{problem}{5.4}
Let $z_{k}$ be independent standard normal variables and define
\[
x(t)=\sqrt{2} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{z_{k}}{\pi k} \sin (\pi k t), \quad 0 \leq t \leq 1
\]
This is the Karhunen-Lo√®ve representation of a Gaussian process with covariance function
\[
r_{x}(s, t)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{2}{\pi^{2} k^{2}} \sin (\pi k s) \sin (\pi k t)
\]
What process is this? Hint: Compare $r_{x}(1-s, 1-t)$ and $r_{x}(s, t).$

\begin{problem}{5.5}
	Let $\{w(t), 0 \leq t<\infty\}$ be standard Brownian motion, and let $A$ have $E(A)=0, V(A)=1,$ and be independent of $\{w(t)\} .$ Suppose that $x(s)=$ $A s+w(s)$ is observed for $0 \leq s \leq t$. Find the best estimate of $A$ in mean square sense of the form $\widehat{A}(t)=\int_{0}^{t} h(t, s) \mathrm{d} x(s) ;[123].$

\]
and prove the optimality claim statement in Remark 5.4.
