\begin{problem}{3.11}
Let $e_{t}, t=0,\pm 1,\pm 2, \ldots,$ be independent standard normal variables and define, for $|\theta|<1$, the stationary processes
\[

b) Express the spectral processes $Z_{x}(\omega)$ and $Z_{y}(\omega)$ in terms of the spectral process $Z_{e}(\omega),$ and derive the cross-spectrum between $x_{t}$ and $y_{t}$

Let $u_{n}$ and $v_{n}$ be two sequences of independent, identically distributed variables with zero mean and let the stationary sequences $x_{n}$ and $y_{n}$ be defined by
