% Problem 1

\begin{problem}{4.1}
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Use the Taylor expansion of $E(e^{i(t_1x_1+t_2x_2+t_3x_3+t_4x_4)})$ to prove
        $$E(x_1x_2x_3x_4) = E(x_1x_2)E(x_3x_4) +E(x_1x_3)E(x_2x_4)+E(x_1x_4)E(x_2x_3)-2E(x_1)E(x_2)E(x_3)E(x_4)$$
        for Gaussian $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$. For normal variables with mean zero, this is a special case of Isserlisâ€™ theorem.
        \item Let $\{x(t), t \in R\}$ be a stationary Gaussian process with mean zero, 
        covariance function $r_x(t)$, and spectral density $f_x(\omega)$, and consider the process
        $$y(t) = x(t) x(t -T)$$
        where $T$ is a constant delay. Derive expressions for the covariance function and spectral density of $y(t)$ 
        in terms of $r_x$ and $f_x$.
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}{4.5}
    Define the process $y(t) = x(t) +\int_0^\infty e^{-u}x(t -u)du$ as the output from a
    linear filter with $x(t)$ as input. What are the impulse and frequency functions of the filter?
     Derive the covariance function and spectrum of $y(t)$ if
    $x(t)$ is stationary with covariance function $r_x(t) = e^{-2|t|}$.
