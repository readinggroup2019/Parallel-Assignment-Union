\begin{problem}{6.14}
Show that the multiplicative random walk:
$$X_{t+1}=X_t\epsilon_t$$
is not irreducible when $\epsilon_{t} \sim \mathcal{E} x p(1)$ and $x_{0} \in \mathbb{R}$.(Hint: Show that it produces
two irreducible components.)

\begin{problem}{6.17}
Show that the split chain defined on $\mathcal{X} \times\{0,1\}$ by the following transition kernel: 
\begin{align*}
    P\left(\check{X}_{n+1} \in A \times\{0\} |\left(x_{n}, 0\right)\right) 
    &=\mathbb{I}_{C}\left(x_{n}\right)\left\{\frac{P\left(X_{n}, A \cap C\right)-\epsilon \nu(A \cap C)}{1-\epsilon}(1-\epsilon)\right. \\
    &\left.+\frac{P\left(X_{n}, A \cap C^{c}\right)-\epsilon \nu\left(A \cap C^{c}\right)}{1-\epsilon}\right\} \\
    &+\mathbb{I}_{C^{c}}\left(X_{n}\right)\left\{P\left(X_{n}, A \cap C\right)(1-\epsilon)+P\left(X_{n}, A \cap C^{c}\right)\right\} \\
    \\
    P\left(\check{X}_{n+1} \in A \times\{1\} |\left(x_{n}, 0\right)\right)
    &=\mathbb{I}_{C}\left(X_{n}\right) \frac{P\left(X_{n}, A \cap C\right)-\epsilon \nu(A \cap C)}{1-\epsilon} \epsilon+\mathbb{I}_{C^{c}}\left(X_{n}\right) P\left(X_{n}, A \cap C\right) \epsilon \\
    \\
    P\left(\bar{X}_{n+1} \in A \times\{0\} |\left(x_{n}, 1\right)\right)&=\nu(A \cap C)(1-\epsilon)+\nu\left(A \cap C^{c}\right) \\
    \\
    P\left(\tilde{X}_{n+1} \in A \times\{1\} |\left(x_{n}, 1\right)\right)&=\nu(A \cap C) \epsilon
\end{align*}
satisfies
$$\begin{array}{c}
    P\left(\check{X}_{n+1} \in A \times\{1\} | \check{x}_{n}\right)=\varepsilon \nu(A \cap C) \\
    P\left(\check{X}_{n+1} \in A \times\{0\} | \check{x}_{n}\right)=\nu\left(A \cap C^{c}\right)+(1-\varepsilon) \nu(A \cap C)
    \end{array}$$
for every $\check{x}_{n} \in C \times\{1\} .$ Deduce that $C \times\{1\}$ is an atom of the split chain $\left(\check{X}_{n}\right)$.

\begin{problem}{6.29(a)}
Establish (i) and (ii) of Theorem 6.28. 

(a)Use
$$K^{n}(x, A) \geq K^{r}(x, \alpha) K^{s}(\alpha, \alpha) K^{t}(\alpha, A)$$
for $r+s+t=n$ and $r$ and $s$ such that
$$K^r(x,\alpha)>0,K^s(\alpha,A)>0$$
to derive from the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations that $\mathbb{E}_{x}\left[\eta_{A}\right]=\infty$ when $\mathbb{E}_{\alpha}\left[\eta_{\alpha}\right]=\infty$
